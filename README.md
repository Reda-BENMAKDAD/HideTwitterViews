# hideTwitterViews

## Description

>`hideTwitterViews` is a simple Chrome extension that removes the views count from tweets on Twitter. With this extension, you can browse Twitter without seeing the number of views for each tweet. (apparently people are annoyed by that)

## Installation

To install the `hideTwitterViews` extension, follow these steps:

1. Download the source code by clicking on the "Code" button on the GitHub repository page and then clicking "Download ZIP" || or clone the repository.
2. Extract the downloaded ZIP file to a folder on your computer.
3. Open the Chrome browser and go to the "Extensions" page (chrome://extensions/).
4. Turn on the "Developer mode" toggle in the top right corner of the page.
5. Click on the "Load unpacked" button in the top left corner of the page.
6. Select the folder where you extracted the extension files and click "Select".

That's it! The `hideTwitterViews` extension should now be installed in your Chrome browser.

## Usage

Once the extension is installed, simply browse Twitter as you normally would. The views count will no longer be displayed for any tweet.
